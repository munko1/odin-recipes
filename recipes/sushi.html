    <h2>How to Make Salmon Rolls</h2>
    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make salmon sushi at home</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>

        <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat</li>
