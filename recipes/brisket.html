    <h2>What Is Corned Beef Brisket?</h2>
    <p>Corned beef is a beef brisket (a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest) that has been cured in a salt
        solution. "Corning" results in intensely flavorful, super tender meat. In this recipe, the corned beef brisket
        is seared in a hot skillet and then braised all day with garlic and onions for a melt-in-your-mouth texture and
        perfect flavor.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil,
            5 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
