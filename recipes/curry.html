    <h2>How to Store Chicken Curry</h2>
    <p>Leftover chicken curry can be refrigerated in a sealed container and enjoyed for two to four days. Freezing
        extends the time to two months â€” simply thaw and gently reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until
            completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
